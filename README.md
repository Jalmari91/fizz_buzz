WHAT?
=====

Implementation to "Fizz buzz" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) problem using template metaprogramming technique.

WHY?
====

Just for fun and I wanted to train myself template metaprogramming technique.

TODO?
=====

At the time code prints numbers in hexadecimal format. It would be better to print in decimal format.
